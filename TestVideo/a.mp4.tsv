0	3100	Donkey Kong! It's a game! Let's do that, I guess. I don't know.
3100	8800	And because I love you and hate sleep and a social life, I'm gonna be testing not one, not two, but three different AI algorithms.
8800	14000	I thought it'd be cool to, like, compare all the algorithms I've used on previous projects on a single project and see who wins.
14000	18900	I'm talking the best of the best. We got genetic algorithm, we got neural evolution of augmented topologies,
18900	21900	and we got proximal policy optimization going head-to-head.
21900	24400	But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Game first, AI later.
24400	25800	Okay, let's make Donkey Kong.
25800	30200	Okay, player onscreen done. It's a square. Very nice. Creative work. Nice.
30200	33200	Now, I could move around the player using Unity's built-in physics system,
33200	37200	but that will animate the player way too smoothly, and in order for it to have that classic arcade feel,
37200	39000	it's gotta have a bit of jank movement in it.
39000	41500	So, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to be a big boy and code the physics myself.
41500	44600	Okay, let's move that player. Can it go right? Yes.
44600	47000	Can it go left? Close enough.
47000	50000	Can it jump? Ah, well, yeah. Ah, close.
50000	51500	Gravity? Yes.
51500	53000	Less gravity? Yes.
53000	55800	Fuck yeah, everything is coming together. This must be what God felt like.
55800	57800	Dude, you're just moving a square around the-
57800	59500	Sideways jumping? Yes.
59500	63500	Sideways jumping and gravity at the same time? Yes.
63500	66500	Woo! Holy shit, he cannot be stopped.
66500	68500	Ground? No.
68500	69500	Oof.
69500	70800	Ground? No.
70800	71500	Tutorial?
71500	76000	Turns true or false depending on weather. The move was successfully com-
76000	76900	Yes.
76900	78400	Ground? No.
78400	79400	Fuck.
79400	80600	Ground? No.
80600	82100	This is getting annoying.
82100	83200	Ground? No.
83200	86700	That's actually pretty aesthetically pleasing, but it's not at all what we're looking for.
86700	88500	Ground? Oh? No?
88500	91300	But we're close. We're close and I can feel it.
91300	92500	Ground? N-
92500	94000	Yes. Yeah.
94000	96000	Fucking easy. Bit of a challenge next time.
96000	98000	Okay, so the ground's done and it's all looking pretty good now.
98000	100800	I know it's nothing revolutionary, but you know, baby steps.
100800	103200	So, the problem with Donkey Kong is that we gotta handle these little steps.
103200	106200	And it's not like a smooth slope either. It's a bunch of individual steps.
106200	108100	You see, if I try this now, it's just gonna-
108100	110100	Oh. Oh, what the- What?
110100	111400	It already works.
111400	114400	I- I don't understand. It never works first try.
114400	116700	Fuck. This has never- This has never happened before.
116700	118400	Oh, I'm- I'm scared.
118400	142400	Oh, no. It's okay. It's okay.
