00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Donkey Kong! It's a game! Let's do that, I guess. I don't know.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,800
And because I love you and hate sleep and a social life, I'm gonna be testing not one, not two, but three different AI algorithms.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,000
I thought it'd be cool to, like, compare all the algorithms I've used on previous projects on a single project and see who wins.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm talking the best of the best. We got genetic algorithm, we got neural evolution of augmented topologies,

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,900
and we got proximal policy optimization going head-to-head.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,400
But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Game first, AI later.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,800
Okay, let's make Donkey Kong.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,200
Okay, player onscreen done. It's a square. Very nice. Creative work. Nice.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Now, I could move around the player using Unity's built-in physics system,

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
but that will animate the player way too smoothly, and in order for it to have that classic arcade feel,

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,000
it's gotta have a bit of jank movement in it.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,500
So, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to be a big boy and code the physics myself.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,600
Okay, let's move that player. Can it go right? Yes.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,000
Can it go left? Close enough.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Can it jump? Ah, well, yeah. Ah, close.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
Gravity? Yes.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Less gravity? Yes.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,800
Fuck yeah, everything is coming together. This must be what God felt like.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Dude, you're just moving a square around the-

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,500
Sideways jumping? Yes.

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Sideways jumping and gravity at the same time? Yes.

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Woo! Holy shit, he cannot be stopped.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Ground? No.

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Oof.

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,800
Ground? No.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,500
Tutorial?

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Turns true or false depending on weather. The move was successfully com-

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,900
Yes.

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,400
Ground? No.

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Fuck.

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Ground? No.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,100
This is getting annoying.

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,200
Ground? No.

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,700
That's actually pretty aesthetically pleasing, but it's not at all what we're looking for.

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,500
Ground? Oh? No?

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,300
But we're close. We're close and I can feel it.

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,500
Ground? N-

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes. Yeah.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Fucking easy. Bit of a challenge next time.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, so the ground's done and it's all looking pretty good now.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,800
I know it's nothing revolutionary, but you know, baby steps.

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,200
So, the problem with Donkey Kong is that we gotta handle these little steps.

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,200
And it's not like a smooth slope either. It's a bunch of individual steps.

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,100
You see, if I try this now, it's just gonna-

45
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,100
Oh. Oh, what the- What?

46
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,400
It already works.

47
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I- I don't understand. It never works first try.

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,700
Fuck. This has never- This has never happened before.

49
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,400
Oh, I'm- I'm scared.

50
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Oh, no. It's okay. It's okay.
